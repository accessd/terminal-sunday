The idea is to provide a graphical and thought-provoking view of one's life span, promoting a reflection on how we spend our time.

## Ruby version

Made initially with Bash, I wrote another version with Ruby language because I love Ruby and to show [Ruby is not dead](https://isrubydead.com/)! :)

## Installation

The script should work on macOS and Linux (The bash script may also work with MINGW).
To use this script, follow the steps below:

1. Download script or clone repository and make sure the script is executable:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/accessd/terminal-sunday/main/terminal_sunday.sh -o "$HOME/terminal_sunday.sh"
chmod +x "$HOME/terminal_sunday.sh"
```

2. Add the script run to the end of .bashrc/.zshrc/etc.

```bash
$HOME/terminal_sunday.sh 1985-06-08 Joe
```

Provide your birthdate and name to the script.

You can run it randomly with:

```bash
(( RANDOM%2 == 0 )) && $HOME/terminal_sunday.sh 1985-06-08 Joe
```

Or add sleep && clear after the command

```bash
$HOME/terminal_sunday.sh 1985-06-08 Joe;sleep 1;clear
```

to clear the screen after one second.

You can specify the number of columns by:

```bash
$HOME/terminal_sunday.sh 1985-06-08 Joe 10
```

the main thing is that 80 is divisible without a remainder by this number of columns :)
